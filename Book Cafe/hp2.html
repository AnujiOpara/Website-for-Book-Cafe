                        <h3>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h3>
                        <p>Harry Potter’s summer has included the worst birthday ever, doomy warnings from a house-elf called Dobby, 
                            and rescue from the Dursleys by his friend Ron Weasley in a magical flying car! Back at Hogwarts School of 
                            Witchcraft And Wizardry for his second year, Harry hears strange whispers echo through empty corridors – and then 
                            the attacks start. Students are found as though turned to stone … Dobby’s sinister predictions seem to be coming true.
