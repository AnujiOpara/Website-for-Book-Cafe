When Percy Jackson gets an urgent distress call from his friend Grover, he immediately prepares for battle.
He knows he will need his powerful demigod allies at his side, his trusty bronze sword Riptide, and… a ride 
from his mom.

The demigods rush to the rescue to find that Grover has made an important discovery: two powerful half-bloods
whose parentage is unknown. But that’s not all that awaits them. The titan lord Kronos has devised his most 
treacherous plot yet, and the young heroes have just fallen prey.

They’re not the only ones in danger. An ancient monster has arisen — one rumored to be so powerful it could 
destroy Olympus — and Artemis, the only goddess who might know how to track it, is missing. Now Percy and his 
friends, along with the Hunters of Artemis, have only a week to find the kidnapped goddess and solve the 
mystery of the monster she was hunting. Along the way, they must face their most dangerous challenge yet: 
the chilling prophecy of the titan’s curse.

isn’t safe, as Kronos’ army prepares to invade its once impenetrable borders. To stop them, Percy and his friends

Along the way Percy will confront powerful enemies, find out the truth about the lost god Pan, and face the Titan 
lord Kronos’ most terrible secret. The final war begins… with the Battle of the Labyrinth.

All year the half-bloods have been preparing for battle against the Titans, knowing the odds of victory are grim. 
Kronos’s army is stronger than ever, and with every god and half-blood he recruits, the evil Titan’s power only grows.

While the Olympians struggle to contain the rampaging monster Typhon, Kronos begins his advance on New York City, 
where Mount Olympus stands virtually unguarded. Now it’s up to Percy Jackson and an army of young demigods to stop the 
Lord of Time. In this momentous final book in the New York Times best-selling Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, 
the long-awaited prophecy surrounding Percy’s sixteenth birthday unfolds. And as the battle for Western civilization 
rages on the streets of Manhattan, Percy faces a terrifying suspicion that he may be fighting against his own fate.
