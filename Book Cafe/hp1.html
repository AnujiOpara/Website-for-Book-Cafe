                        <h3>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</h3>
                        <p>Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat 
                            at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, 
                            they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harryâ€™s eleventh birthday, 
                            a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some 
                            astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
                            An incredible adventure is about to begin!
