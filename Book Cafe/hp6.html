                        <h3>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h3>
                        <p>When Dumbledore arrives at Privet Drive one summer night to collect Harry Potter, his wand hand is blackened 
                            and shrivelled, but he does not reveal why. Secrets and suspicion are spreading through the wizarding world, 
                            and Hogwarts itself is not safe. Harry is convinced that Malfoy bears the Dark Mark: there is a Death Eater 
                            amongst them. Harry will need powerful magic and true friends as he explores Voldemortâ€™s darkest secrets, and 
                            Dumbledore prepares him to face his destiny.
