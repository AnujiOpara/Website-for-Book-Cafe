                        <h3>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</h3>
                        <p>The Wizarding World journey continues . . . The powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald was captured 
                            in New York with the help of Newt Scamander. But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escapes custody 
                            and sets about gathering followers, most of whom are unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood 
                            wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings. In an effort to thwart Grindelwaldâ€™s plans, Albus Dumbledore 
                            enlists Newt, his former Hogwarts student, who agrees to help once again, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. 
                            Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly 
                            divided wizarding world. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is the second screenplay in a five-film 
                            series to be written by J.K. Rowling, author of the internationally bestselling Harry Potter books. Set in 1927, 
                            a few months after the events of Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, and moving from New York to London, 
                            Paris and even back to Hogwarts, this story of mystery and magic reveals an extraordinary new chapter in the 
                            wizarding world. Illustrated with stunning line art from MinaLima with some surprising nods to the Harry Potter 
                            stories that will delight fans of both the books and films.
