                        <h3>Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore</h3>
                        <p>Professor Albus Dumbledore knows the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald is moving to seize control of 
                            the wizarding world. Unable to stop him alone, he entrusts Magizoologist Newt Scamander to lead an intrepid 
                            team of wizards, witches, and one brave Muggle baker on a dangerous mission, where they encounter old and 
                            new beasts and clash with Grindelwaldâ€™s growing legion of followers. But with the stakes so high, how long 
                            can Dumbledore remain on the sidelines?
